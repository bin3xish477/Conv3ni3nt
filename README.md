# Conv3ni3nt [![Kali](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Kali-informational)](https://www.kali.org/) [![Python3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python3-yellow)](https://www.python.org/)

Conv3ni3nt was made to simplify the scanning process of a pentration test. All of a pentester's favorite scans can be initiated from Conv3ni3nt's easy-to-use interface while also providing the user with immediate access to data generated by each scan by opening the files created and located in the current directory. There are a number of common tools to use with Conv3ni3nt and more tools can be added simply by appending the desired tool to the **VALID_TOOLS** list defined within the **conv3ni3nt.py** module. 

**Note**: appending tools that prompt for user input during scans will cause the program to run indefinitely. Avoid these kinds of tools.
# About Conv3ni3nt
Conv3ni3nt utilizes the the subclass **ThreadPoolExecutor** that is part of the abstract class **Executor** found in the concurrent.futures module. This subclass allocates threads for the program to use to execute callables. In Conv3ni3nt's case, we are using **ThreadPoolExecutor** to asynchronously run scans using multi threading.
