Conv3ni3nt was made for the purpose of simpliying the scanning process of a pentration test. All of a pentester's favorite scans can be initiated from the easy-to-use interface while also providing available output to each file containing the data generated by the scans. There are a number of tools to use with Conv3ni3nt and more tools can be added simply by appending the desired tool to the VALID_TOOLS list defined within the conv3ni3nt.py module. **Note**: appending tools that prompt for user input during scans will cause the problem to run indefinitely. Avoid these kinds of tools.
